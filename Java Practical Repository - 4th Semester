This repository contains my Java practical exercises completed during the 4th semester. Explore basic syntax, Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles like inheritance and encapsulation, along with data structures (ArrayList, LinkedList) and algorithms (sorting, searching). To run these programs, ensure you have the Java Development Kit (JDK) installed. Clone the repository, compile Java files with javac, and run them with java. Contributions are welcome via pull requests or issue submissions. Licensed under MIT. Let's delve into Java fundamentals together!
